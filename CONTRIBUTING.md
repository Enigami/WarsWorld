# Contributing
Before anything else, thanks for considering contributing to Wars World, its thanks to people like you that AW community can grow and continue to enjoy this beautiful game.

### Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make an issue for it](https://github.com/WarsWorld/WarsWorld/issues/new)! It's
generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature
request this way before starting to code. Its always good to communicate with the team so we can plan together

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork WarsWorld and create
a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be descriptive of what you are working for, for example if its an update to the mobile navbar, it could be mobile-navbar-update. 

## Setting up your local environment

Still need to work on how to setup a local environment on our new tech stack. Will be here soon!

## RoadMap / Vision
Currently the project intends to recreate AWBW but with 2023 technology. Meaning we want to have a live league that works smoothly, a hot from the oven UI/UX thats reponsive and streamlines games, being able to look at multiple games at the same time, having a much faster website/not having lag, etc.

However, AWBW has a lot of parts to it, so we decided that for now, our scope is delivering a live league queue. We want to avoid direct competition with AWBW for as far as we can and creating one gamemode and one queue initially is a good scope for the project to start. Later on we can add new gamemodes such as fog, custom CO/skills, etc.

We do not have plans on remaking AW or making our own game/version of it, we want to stay close to what AWBW has accomplished because this project is made by AWBW players that want to play the game on a modern avenue.

Below we will soon have our github projects and their full roadmaps.

### Contact Information
